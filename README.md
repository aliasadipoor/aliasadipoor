# Frontend Developer
 Hello!
I'm Ali asdipour, a front-end programmer with great interest and motivation since studying computer science. I started working in this field.
## About ME
I use my technical skills and front-end experience and am always looking for new ways to improve the user experience (UX). I believe that a front-end developer should use his skills to understand the needs of users in the best possible way.
In addition to technical skills, I also teach communication skills and important tasks. I believe that a Frand programmer should communicate well with users and other team members
